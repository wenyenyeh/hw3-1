Create a simple interactive web app that compares logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) models on a 1-dimensional dataset. Use Streamlit to deploy the app:</br>

<h3>1.Visualize a 1D classification dataset with data points labeled as two classes.</h3></br>
<h3>2.Train logistic regression and SVM models on this data.</h3></br>
<h3>3.Plot and display each modelâ€™s decision boundary and probability curve on the same graph.</h3></br>
<h3>4.Show the accuracy of both models on the dataset.</h3></br>
