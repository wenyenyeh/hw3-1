Create a simple interactive web app that compares logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) models on a 1-dimensional dataset. Use Streamlit to deploy the app:</br>

1.Visualize a 1D classification dataset with data points labeled as two classes.</br>
2.Train logistic regression and SVM models on this data.</br>
3.Plot and display each model’s decision boundary and probability curve on the same graph.</br>
4.Show the accuracy of both models on the dataset.</br>
